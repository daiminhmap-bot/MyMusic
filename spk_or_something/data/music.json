        "lyrics":"Eurt si em tuoba yas yeht gnihtyrevE Euphoria \n Them superpowers getting neutralized, I can only watch in silence \n The famous actor we once knew is lookin' paranoid and now spiralin' \n You're movin' just like a degenerate, every antic is feelin' distasteful /n I calculate you're not as calculated, I can even predict your angle /n Fabricating stories on the family front 'cause you heard Mr. Morale /n A pathetic master manipulator, I can smell the tales on you now /n You're not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being accepted /n Tommy Hilfiger stood out, but FUBU never had been your collection /n I make music that electrify 'em, you make music that pacify 'em I can double down on that line, but spare you this time, that's random acts of kindness /n Know you a master manipulator and habitual liar too /n But don't tell no lie about me and I won't tell truths 'bout you /n Shoo, shoo, shoo /n Shoo, shoo, shoo /n Bee, bee, bee, bee, bee, bee /n Yeah, I'm out the way, yeah, I'm low, okay /n Yeah, the island right here's remote, okay /n I ain't thinkin' about no reaper /n Nigga, I'm reapin' what I sow, okay /n Got a Benjamin and a Jackson all in my house like I'm Joe, okay /n Hellcat, made his homeboys and them type sell they soul, okay /n Everybody wanna be demon 'til they get chipped by your throwaway /n And I might do a show a day, once a lame, always a lame /n Oh, you thought the money, the power or fame would make you go away? /n Have you ever played have-you-ever? Okay, nigga, let's play /n Have you ever walked your enemy down like with a poker face? /n Have you ever paid five hundred thou' like to an open case? /n Well, I have, and I failed at both, but I came out straight /n I hate when a rapper talk about guns, then somebody die /n They turn into nuns, then hop online, like Pray for my city /n He fakin' for likes and digital hugs /n His daddy a killer, he wanna be junior, they must've forgot the shit that they done /n Dementia must run in his family, but let it get shaky /n I'll park his son /n The very first time I shot me a Drac', the homie had told me to aim it this way /n I didn't point down enough, today, I'll show you I learned from those mistakes /n Somebody had told me that you got a ring, on God, I'm ready to double the wage /n I'd rather do that than let a Canadian nigga make Pac turn in his grave /n Cutthroat business, you got shit twisted /n What is it? The braids? /n I hurt your feelings? You don't wanna work with me no more? Okay /n It's three G.O.A.T.s left, and I seen two of them kissin' and huggin' on stage /n I love 'em to death, and in eight bars, I'll explain that phrase, huh /n It's nothin' nobody can tell me, huh /n I don't wanna talk on no celly, huh /n You know I got language barriers, huh /n It's no accent you can sell me, huh /n Yeah, Cole and Aubrey know I'm a selfish nigga, the crown is heavy, huh /n I pray they my real friends, if not, I'm YNW Melly /n I don't like you poppin' shit at Pharrell, for him, I inherit the beef /n Yeah, fuck all that pushin' P, let me see you push a T /n You better off spinnin' again on him, you think about pushin' me /n He's Terrence Thornton, I'm Terence Crawford, yeah, I'm whoopin' feet /n We ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way /n I know some shit about niggas that make Gunna Wunna look like a saint /n This ain't been about critics, not about gimmicks, not about who the greatest /n It's always been about love and hate, now let me say I'm the biggest hater /n I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress /n I hate the way that you sneak diss, if I catch flight, it's gon' be direct /n We hate the bitches you fuck, 'cause they confuse themself with real women /n And notice, I said we, it's not just me, I'm what the culture feelin'/n How many more fairytale stories 'bout your life 'til we had enough? /n How many more Black features 'til you finally feel that you're Black enough? /n I like Drake with the melodies, I don't like Drake when he act tough /n You gon' make a nigga bring back Puff, let me see if Chubbs really crash somethin' /n Yeah, my first one like my last one, it's a classic, you don't have one /n Let your core audience stomach that, then tell 'em where you get your abs from /n V12, it's a fast one, baow-baow-baow, last one /n Headshot for the year, you better walk around like Daft Punk /n Remember? /n Ay, Top /n Dawg, who the fuck they think they playin' with? /n Extortion my middle name as soon as you jump off of that plane, bitch /n I'm allergic to the lame shit, only you like bein' famous /n Yachty can't give you no swag neither, I don't give a fuck 'bout who you hang with /n I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress /n Surprised you wanted that feature request /n You know that we got some shit to address /n I even hate when you say the word nigga, but that's just me, I guess /n Some shit just cringeworthy, it ain't even gotta be deep, I guess /n Still love when you see success, everything with me is blessed /n Keep makin' me dance, wavin' my hand, and it won't be no threat /n I'm knowin' they call you The Boy, but where is a man? 'Cause I ain't seen him yet /n Matter fact, I ain't even bleed him yet, can I bleed him? Bet /n When I see you stand by Sexyy Red, I believe you see two bad bitches /n I believe you don't like women, it's real competition, you might pop ass with 'em /n Let's speak on percentage, show me your splits, I'll make sure I double back with you /n You were signed to a nigga that's signed to a nigga that said he was signed to that nigga /n Try cease and desist on the Like That record? /n Hoe, what? You ain't like that record? /n Back To Back,  I like that record /n I'ma get back to that, for the record /n Why would I call around tryna get dirt on niggas? Y'all think all my life is rap? /n That's hoe shit, I got a son to raise, but I can see you don't know nothin' 'bout that /n Wakin' him up, know nothin' 'bout that /n And tell him to pray, know nothin' 'bout that /n And givin' him tools to walk through life like day-by-day, know nothin' 'bout that /n Teachin' him morals, integrity, discipline, listen, man, you don't know nothin' 'bout that /n Speakin' the truth and consider what God's considerin', you don't know nothin' 'bout that /n Ain't 20-v-1, it's 1-v-20 if I gotta smack niggas that write with you /n Yeah, bring 'em out too, I'll clean 'em out too /n Tell BEAM that he better stay right with you /n Am I battlin' ghost or AI? Nigga feelin' like Joel Hale Osteen /n Funny, he was in a film called AI /n And my sixth sense tellin' me to off him /n I'ma blick niggas all in they coffin /n Yeah, OV-hoe niggas is dick riders /n Tell 'em run to America, they imitate heritage, they can't imitate this violence /n What I learned is niggas don't like the West Coast /n And I'm fine with it, I'll push the line with it /n Pick a nigga off one at a time with it /n We can be on a three-hour time difference /n Don't speak on the family, crodie /n It can get deep in the family, crodie /n Talk about me and my family, crodie? /n Someone gon' bleed in your family, crodie /n I be at New Ho King eatin' fried rice with a dip sauce and blammy, crodie /n Tell me you're cheesin', fam /n We can do this right now on the camera, crodie /n Ay, fuck y'all niggas, I don't trust y'all niggas /n I wave one finger and thump y'all niggas like, /n         Mm /n Field goal, punt y'all niggas, they punk y'all niggas, nobody never took my food /n Whoever that's fuckin' with him, fuck you niggas, and fuck the industry too /n If you take it there, I'm takin' it further /n Psst, that's somethin' you don't wanna do /n Ooh /n We don't wanna hear you say nigga no more /n We don't wanna hear you say nigga no more /n Stop /n"
