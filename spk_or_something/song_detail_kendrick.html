            <p>Eurt si em tuoba yas yeht gnihtyrevE<br>
                Euphoria<br>
                Them superpowers getting neutralized, I can only watch in silence<br>
                The famous actor we once knew is lookin' paranoid and now spiralin'<br>
                You're movin' just like a degenerate, every antic is feelin' distasteful<br>
                I calculate you're not as calculated, I can even predict your angle<br>
                Fabricating stories on the family front 'cause you heard Mr. Morale<br>
                A pathetic master manipulator, I can smell the tales on you now<br>
                You're not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being accepted<br>
                Tommy Hilfiger stood out, but FUBU never had been your collection<br>
                I make music that electrify 'em, you make music that pacify 'em
                I can double down on that line, but spare you this time, that's random acts of kindness<br>
                Know you a master manipulator and habitual liar too<br>
                But don't tell no lie about me and I won't tell truths 'bout you<br>
                <br>
                Shoo, shoo, shoo<br>
                Shoo, shoo, shoo<br>
                Bee, bee, bee, bee, bee, bee<br>
                Yeah, I'm out the way, yeah, I'm low, okay<br>
                Yeah, the island right here's remote, okay<br>
                I ain't thinkin' about no reaper<br>
                Nigga, I'm reapin' what I sow, okay<br>
                Got a Benjamin and a Jackson all in my house like I'm Joe, okay<br>
                Hellcat, made his homeboys and them type sell they soul, okay<br>
                Everybody wanna be demon 'til they get chipped by your throwaway<br>
                And I might do a show a day, once a lame, always a lame<br>
                Oh, you thought the money, the power or fame would make you go away?<br>
                Have you ever played have-you-ever? Okay, nigga, let's play<br>
                Have you ever walked your enemy down like with a poker face?<br>
                Have you ever paid five hundred thou' like to an open case?<br>
                Well, I have, and I failed at both, but I came out straight<br>
                I hate when a rapper talk about guns, then somebody die<br>
                They turn into nuns, then hop online, like "Pray for my city"<br>
                He fakin' for likes and digital hugs<br>
                His daddy a killer, he wanna be junior, they must've forgot the shit that they done<br>
                Dementia must run in his family, but let it get shaky<br>
                <br>
                I'll park his son<br>
                The very first time I shot me a Drac', the homie had told me to aim it this way<br>
                I didn't point down enough, today, I'll show you I learned from those mistakes<br>
                Somebody had told me that you got a ring, on God, I'm ready to double the wage<br>
                I'd rather do that than let a Canadian nigga make Pac turn in his grave<br>
                Cutthroat business, you got shit twisted<br>
                What is it? The braids?<br>
                I hurt your feelings? You don't wanna work with me no more? Okay<br>
                It's three G.O.A.T.s left, and I seen two of them kissin' and huggin' on stage<br>
                I love 'em to death, and in eight bars, I'll explain that phrase, huh<br>
                It's nothin' nobody can tell me, huh<br>
                I don't wanna talk on no celly, huh<br>
                You know I got language barriers, huh<br>
                <br>
                It's no accent you can sell me, huh<br>
                Yeah, Cole and Aubrey know I'm a selfish nigga, the crown is heavy, huh<br>
                I pray they my real friends, if not, I'm YNW Melly<br>
                I don't like you poppin' shit at Pharrell, for him, I inherit the beef<br>
                Yeah, fuck all that pushin' P, let me see you push a T<br>
                You better off spinnin' again on him, you think about pushin' me<br>
                He's Terrence Thornton, I'm Terence Crawford, yeah, I'm whoopin' feet<br>
                We ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way<br>
                I know some shit about niggas that make Gunna Wunna look like a saint<br>
                This ain't been about critics, not about gimmicks, not about who the greatest<br>
                It's always been about love and hate, now let me say I'm the biggest hater<br>
                I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress<br>
                I hate the way that you sneak diss, if I catch flight, it's gon' be direct<br>
                We hate the bitches you fuck, 'cause they confuse themself with real women<br>
                And notice, I said "we, " it's not just me, I'm what the culture feelin'<br>
                How many more fairytale stories 'bout your life 'til we had enough?<br>
                How many more Black features 'til you finally feel that you're Black enough?<br>
                I like Drake with the melodies, I don't like Drake when he act tough<br>
                You gon' make a nigga bring back Puff, let me see if Chubbs really crash somethin'<br>
                Yeah, my first one like my last one, it's a classic, you don't have one<br>
                Let your core audience stomach that, then tell 'em where you get your abs from<br>
                V12, it's a fast one, baow-baow-baow, last one<br>
                Headshot for the year, you better walk around like Daft Punk<br>
                Remember?<br>
                <br>
                Ay, Top Dawg, who the fuck they think they playin' with?<br>
                Extortion my middle name as soon as you jump off of that plane, bitch<br>
                I'm allergic to the lame shit, only you like bein' famous<br>
                Yachty can't give you no swag neither, I don't give a fuck 'bout who you hang with<br>
                I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress<br>
                Surprised you wanted that feature request<br>
                You know that we got some shit to address<br>
                I even hate when you say the word "nigga, " but that's just me, I guess<br>
                Some shit just cringeworthy, it ain't even gotta be deep, I guess<br>
                Still love when you see success, everything with me is blessed<br>
                Keep makin' me dance, wavin' my hand, and it won't be no threat<br>
                I'm knowin' they call you The Boy, but where is a man? 'Cause I ain't seen him yet<br>
                Matter fact, I ain't even bleed him yet, can I bleed him? Bet<br>
                When I see you stand by Sexyy Red, I believe you see two bad bitches<br>
                I believe you don't like women, it's real competition, you might pop ass with 'em<br>
                Let's speak on percentage, show me your splits, I'll make sure I double back with you<br>
                You were signed to a nigga that's signed to a nigga that said he was signed to that nigga<br>
                Try cease and desist on the "Like That" record?<br>
                Hoe, what? You ain't like that record?<br>
                "Back To Back, " I like that record<br>
                I'ma get back to that, for the record<br>
                Why would I call around tryna get dirt on niggas? Y'all think all my life is rap?<br>
                That's hoe shit, I got a son to raise, but I can see you don't know nothin' 'bout that<br>
                Wakin' him up, know nothin' 'bout that<br>
                And tell him to pray, know nothin' 'bout that<br>
                And givin' him tools to walk through life like day-by-day, know nothin' 'bout that<br>
                <br>
                Teachin' him morals, integrity, discipline, listen, man, you don't know nothin' 'bout that<br>
                Speakin' the truth and consider what God's considerin', you don't know nothin' 'bout that<br>
                Ain't 20-v-1, it's 1-v-20 if I gotta smack niggas that write with you<br>
                Yeah, bring 'em out too, I'll clean 'em out too<br>
                Tell BEAM that he better stay right with you<br>
                Am I battlin' ghost or AI? Nigga feelin' like Joel Hale Osteen<br>
                Funny, he was in a film called "AI"<br>
                And my sixth sense tellin' me to off him<br>
                I'ma blick niggas all in they coffin<br>
                Yeah, OV-hoe niggas is dick riders<br>
                Tell 'em run to America, they imitate heritage, they can't imitate this violence<br>
                What I learned is niggas don't like the West Coast<br>
                And I'm fine with it, I'll push the line with it<br>
                Pick a nigga off one at a time with it<br>
                We can be on a three-hour time difference<br>
                Don't speak on the family, crodie<br>
                It can get deep in the family, crodie<br>
                Talk about me and my family, crodie?<br>
                Someone gon' bleed in your family, crodie<br>
                I be at New Ho King eatin' fried rice with a dip sauce and blammy, crodie<br>
                Tell me you're cheesin', fam<br>
                We can do this right now on the camera, crodie<br>
                Ay, fuck y'all niggas, I don't trust y'all niggas<br>
                I wave one finger and thump y'all niggas like, "Mm"<br>
                Field goal, punt y'all niggas, they punk y'all niggas, nobody never took my food<br>
                Whoever that's fuckin' with him, fuck you niggas, and fuck the industry too<br>
                <br>
                If you take it there, I'm takin' it further<br>
                Psst, that's somethin' you don't wanna do<br>
                Ooh<br>
                We don't wanna hear you say "nigga" no more<br>
                We don't wanna hear you say "nigga" no more<br>
